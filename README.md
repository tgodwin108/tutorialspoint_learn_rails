Found a simple tutorial that didn't seem to worry about the version of Ruby or Rails. Just wanted something with a beginning, a middle, and an end.


# Linode VM Setup
* update Linux libs
    * create the ~/bin/update.sh script with these commands:
      * `sudo apt upgrade`
      * `sudo apt update -y`
      * `sudo apt autoremove`
      * `sudo apt autoclean`
* install RVM
    * I already installed RVM and didn't write down the staps I used.
    * Update RVM to the latest version
      * `rvm get stable`
* install Ruby
